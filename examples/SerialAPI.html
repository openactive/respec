<section id='abstract'>
The Serial API provides a way for websites to read and write from a
serial device through script. Such an API would bridge the web and the
physical world, by allowing documents to communicate with devices such
as microcontrollers, 3D printers, and other serial devices.

## Usage example
This example shows how to find the first "Arduino" device and set it up for use.

<pre class="example highlight">
// Request the list of ports from the user
SerialPort.requestList().then(ports => {
  // Pick the first matching port
  var serial,
      kind = "Arduino"
      arduinos = ports.filter(port =&gt; port.manufacturer.includes(kind));

  if (arduinos.length) {
     serial = new SerialPort(arduinos[0].path);
     serial.in.read(readData)
  }

  function readData(){
    while(let data = yield serial.read()) {
      console.log(data);
    }
  }
})
.catch(console.error);
</pre>

## Security Considerations
User agents must not grant Web sites access to any serial ports without
the express permission of the user. A conforming implementation of this
specification must provide a means for user to control which serial
ports the API can access, as well as a means for the end-user to be
able to revoke all access to serial ports.

## Use cases and requirements

### Hardware disconnection
Some devices allow users to manually reset the connection between the user
agent and the physical device (e.g., by pushing a button). One example
device is the Arduino. Another example is the user abruptly disconnecting
one device from another, thus severing the communication channel.

As such, it is a requirement that the API gracefully handle abrupt
disconnection caused by a reset or other event. When such disconnections
occur, the API must make it possible for the developer to be notified of such
disconnections. When possible, the API should provide details about the
disconnection (e.g., reason, time, etc.).

### Baud rates
Traditionally, serial devices have operated at
[baud rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud)
of between 50 and 115,200 bps.

However, modern USB serial devices are able to operate at significantly higher
baud rates than legacy hardware. For example, the
[bioloid servos](http://support.robotis.com/en/techsupport_eng.htm#product/dynamixel/ax_series/dxl_ax_actuator.htm)
operate at 1 Mbit (1,000,000 bps). Other USB-to-serial chips are able to
 operate at 3 MBit (3,000,000bps).

Additionally, other serial devices have standardized baud rates that
are not in the commonly accepted value for baud rates. For example,
[MIDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) uses a baud rate of 31,250 bps,
while a [DMX512 controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512)
transmits data at 250kbps.

As such, it is a requirement that the Serial API does not limit the
baud rates to a traditional range. Instead, the API must allow a
developer to specify any rate so long as the value is an unsigned number.
If there is a baud rate that is common for a large range of hardware that
will make use of this API, the API should provide a default baud rate value.

Given the above requirement, it is possible to create software to wrap the
Serial API to restrict the possible baud rates used for communicating with some
particular hardware. For example, a JavaScript library that communicates with
a MIDI device could automatically set the baud rate to 31,250 bps without
needing to bother the developer to specify the value.
